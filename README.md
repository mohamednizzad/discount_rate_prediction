# Discount Rate Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting discount rates based on Invoice Amount (Sales Amount) for retail pharmaceutical companies. Accurate discount rate prediction is crucial for various financial applications, including valuation, investment analysis, and risk assessment.

## Objectives
- Develop machine learning models to predict discount rates based on sales data.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
- Provide insights into factors influencing discount rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical discount rates along with other invoice data. It includes features such as invoiceAmount, invoiceDiscountRate, Etc.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identify key features influencing discount rates using feature importance techniques.
3. **Model Development:** Train and evaluate machine learning models, including regression and ensemble methods.
4. **Model Tuning:** Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
5. **Evaluation:** Compare models based on metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
6. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict future discount rates.

## Results
- **Model Performance:** The best-performing model achieved .

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more granular data at the regional or industry level for better predictions.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, for improved accuracy.
- Continuously update the model with new data to enhance prediction capabilities.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting discount rates for sales data. Accurate discount rate prediction can provide valuable insights for decision-making in various financial scenarios.
